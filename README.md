# AI-Riddle-Quest on Mantle

Mantle-AIQuest is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages the power of an oracle-based system to create logic-based riddles and competitions. Participants can solve riddles, submit their answers, and win prizes if their answers meet the required score criteria. The smart contract handles validation and prize distribution, ensuring transparency and fairness.
